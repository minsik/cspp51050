Two ways of doing this:
1. c way: in main, initialize (client, server) //that runs all other functions
    and run clientquery(function name, args)
    
2. c++ way: run everything in client so the queries are run via a client member function. i.e.:
        decl slient
        decl serve
        client.connect(server)
        client.query(server, fun, args) //decide whether this returns value
                                        //or manually call a get function
        
    (are you the client or are you someone manipulating the client/server?)
    
    
    
is the user interacting through the console?
or is the user another programmer who will be entering calls in the driver?




while (1)
    ask for input
    if (input type == 2 ints)
        call server w add
    else if (input type == str)
        call server w strength
    else
        bad input
    return value to user (by print)
    ask if user wants to input again.
